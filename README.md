# Spaceship-game

Hi again guys! This time I do a spaceship game in Unity. I wanted to prove this game engime a lot of time ago
and well, I done it. 

In this 2D game you can find a spaceship that can shoot to the other spaceships enemies. The player can obtain
differents powers depends on the special cube power that it pick up. There are three types of Powers:
   - Blaster: This kind of power give you the ability of shoot with your five cannons. You can use the five cannons 
   if you will pick up five cubes power.
   - Spread: With this, you can shoot three bullets in three directions together! the first bullet go forward and the others 
   deviate 30 degrees to right and left.
   - Shield: At last, shield give you a extra spaceship defense. You can have 4 shield together.

Also I done a basic menu with two buttons, play an credits, and the credits show my name and my
github.

One thing that I investiged a lot of time was how to go to other scene in unity but without lost a gameobject. I put
in a situation, I wanted that if I click in the play button, the background (it does the parallax scrolling) doesn't 
start again but the background continue executing normally. At last, I done this with a Singleton.

Finally, The enemies go out by hordes, that is to say, you can specify the order in which the enemies go out.

And that it's all! I want to continue working in Unity. Now I haven't got so much time to do thing by my own, but
in summer in think that I do a good project.

If you can play it, you can do it on the next link:
